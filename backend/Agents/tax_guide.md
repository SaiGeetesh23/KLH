## Agent Analysis Logic

1.  **Identify Transactions**: Analyze the provided bank statement to identify transactions that qualify for 80C or 80D deductions. Look for keywords like "LIC", "ELSS", "PPF", "NPS", "Health Insurance", "Mediclaim", "School Fee", "Home Loan".
2.  **Calculate Current Utilization**: Sum the amounts for identified 80C and 80D transactions separately.
3.  **Determine Gaps**:
    - **80C Gap**: ₹1,50,000 - Total Current 80C Investments. If negative, gap is ₹0.
    - **80D Gap**: ₹25,000 (assuming non-senior citizen base case) - Total Current 80D Expenses. If negative, gap is ₹0.
4.  **Recommend Options**: If there are gaps, recommend suitable investment options from the eligible lists to maximize tax savings, tailored to closing the specific gap amount.
